# nodecodetest

First time working with Node for backend, usually I would have made a project like this in Python.

Two scripts of importance:
npm run parse, will compile and run the parse.ts file, running the name finder algorithm on Oliver Twist

npm run dev will run open the API server, on PORT 7000. It uses a txt file generated by Oliver Twist as database
API does not support https, so make sure to make requests using http. Name parameters are case sensitive
